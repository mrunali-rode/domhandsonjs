         <h4>Que 6. Whats the difference between window vs document?</h4> 
         <pre>
            Ans: <b>Windows :</b>
            window is the main JavaScript object root, aka the global object in a browser, and it can also be treated as the root of the document object model. <br>
            You can access it as window.window.screen or just screen is a small information object about physical screen dimensions.
            window.document or just document is the main object of the potentially visible (or better yet: rendered) document object model/DOM.
            Since window is the global object, you can reference any properties of it with just the property name - so you do not have to write down window.  br
            - it will be figured out by the runtime.
            <b>Document : </b>
            Each window object has a document object to be rendered. These objects get confused in part because HTML elements are added to the global object <br>
             when assigned a unique id. E.g., in the HTML snippet The document object is your html, aspx, php, or other document that will be loaded into the browser. <br>
            The document actually gets loaded inside the window object and has properties available to it like title, URL, cookie, etc. What does this really mean? That <br>
             means if you want to access a property for the window it is window.property, if it is document it is window.document.property which is also available in short as 
             document.property.
